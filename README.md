## TBD

- test binding to local in div



- callbacks -- pass locals :on-click (ui/add-user #@ :user) or (ui/add-user :user)
- #get/#< binding for cells -> reaction.
- #< binding for markup -> same as for cells or derefing right away.
- cell expressions :first-user queries/first-user -> reaction based on globals only

- binding local -> local in epressions
- Nested markup with #bind in inner elements.
